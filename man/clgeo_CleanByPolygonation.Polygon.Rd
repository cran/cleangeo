\usage{
clgeo_CleanByPolygonation.Polygon(p, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{object of class \code{\link[sp]{Polygon-class}} as defined in \pkg{sp}}

\item{verbose}{Indicates wether the clean logs have to be printed. Default value is FALSE.}
}
\value{
a list of objects of class \code{\link[sp]{Polygon-class}} as defined in \pkg{sp},
with cleaned geometries.
}
\description{
Function to clean a \code{\link[sp]{Polygon-class}} object by polygonation.
}
\note{
The polygonation method is a tentative alternate method to triangulation to clean
geometries. In this method, triangulation is skipped and a re-polygonation algorithm is
applied.
